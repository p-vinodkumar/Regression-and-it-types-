### Overview

This project provides a detailed explanation and implementation of Regression techniques, a fundamental concept in Machine Learning.
Regression is used to model and analyze the relationships between variables and to predict continuous outcomes.

This Jupyter Notebook (regression-and-its-types.ipynb) performs a regression analysis on the California Housing Prices dataset, exploring various regression techniques to predict median house values.

### Dataset

The California Housing Prices dataset includes features like:
- Median income



- Housing median age
- Average rooms, bedrooms, and occupancy
-Population
- Latitude and longitude
-Ocean proximity (categorical)

The target variable is the median house value.

### Objectives

- Apply and compare different regression algorithms.
- Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
-  Visualize actual vs. predicted values.
- Explain regression techniques for continuous target prediction.

### Regression Techniques

The notebook covers:

- <b>Linear Regression</b>: Models linear relationships.
- <b>Ridge Regression</b>: Linear regression with L2 regularization.
- <b>Lasso Regression</b>: Linear regression with L1 regularization.
- <b>Polynomial Regression</b>: Captures non-linear patterns.
- <b>Decision Tree Regression</b>: Non-linear tree-based model.
- <b>Random Forest Regression</b>: Ensemble method for better accuracy.
